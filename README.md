# Milionerzy


This program is brought to simulate a well-known TV show ‘Who wants to be a millionaire’. Yet that is the simulation of the polish version of the show, the aim of a player is to win 1,000,000 PLN. In order to achieve that they are supposed to be asked 12 multiple-choice questions and answer them correctly. The host of the program asks a question and the participant is given 4 options of the answer, one of which is right. If the player fails at any stage of the game he loses immediately. Answering correctly for the second question guarantees that the player wins at least 1,000 PLN. Having answered properly 7 times in a row, the player is certain to win not less than 32,000 PLN.  The general pattern of the questions selection is the more money you are able to win in the current round, the harder the question is. There is no time limit for the player to answer the question. After having considered which option is in their opinion right the player chooses it and the host tells them whether it is a good answer or not. At any moment of the show, the participant is allowed to resign from continuing and take the amount of money they have reached until that moment. This is the money tree of the polish version of the show: 

__Question number___|___Prize in PLN____
         1          |       500
         2          |       1,000 
         3          |       2,000
         4          |       4,000
         5          |       8,000
         6          |       16,000
         7          |       32,000
         8          |       64,000
         9          |       128,000
        10          |       250,000
        11          |       500,000
        12          |       1,000,000



This game would be way too hard unless there were any facilities. In our simulation there are three lifelines which user may use at any stage of the game. Those are: 50/50 which removes two randomly chosen incorrect answers; Phone A Friend which lets them call a friend who is right in 75 per cent cases and Ask The Audience in which people in the audience are asked the same question and the player is reported about their answer which is 60 per cent times correct.
